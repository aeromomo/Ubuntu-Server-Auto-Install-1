I know Sabnzbd, Sickrage, Couchpotato, Transmission, CherryMusic are included.

I have a few suggestions for additions:

Mylar & Headphones (Atomic has?)
Plex (if you have Kodi, Plex server is handy for choice!)
aMule (for ED2K)
Beets
Nzbmegasearch
Jackett
Calibre or Ubooqity (or both!)
DuckDNS
Get-iplayer
