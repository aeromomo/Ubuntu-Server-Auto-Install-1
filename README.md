(Currently Using 16.04.2 LTS Server 64bit as of 3/20/2017)   
My setup is great for Fresh installs and for Reinstall with applying your current settings   
   
Steps are under Wiki for installation and creating the ISO   
Before creating ISO edit FirstbootInstall.sh for what programs to be install   

If anyone has ideas to help set up the process faster or add more programs to this list feel free to Click on the Feature Link  
  
**I will be replacing username, passwords with xxxusernamexxx and xxxpasswordxxx to help with replacing with credentials easy .... if anyone knows how to work in a "probing" .sh for that info to use on the full install let me know I will work it in**  
   
Take a look also to my mini plex server instructions / might create a auto install for it soon to
