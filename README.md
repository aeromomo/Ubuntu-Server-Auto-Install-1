# Ubuntu Server Auto Install 
(Currently Using 16.04.2 LTS Server 64bit as of 3/20/2017)

Credit for begining work on Creating Custom Auto Install Server ISO
https://pricklytech.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/ubuntu-server-unattended-installation-custom-cd/

Steps are under Wiki for installation and creating the ISO

Before creating ISO edit FirstbootInstall.sh unless on usb flash drive for control on what programs install with commenting out unneeded programs

If anyone has ideas to help set up the process faster or add more programs to this list feel free to reach out to me

For my Media server protection I will be removing username, passwords, and etc with xxxusernamexxx and xxxpasswordxxx, etc to help with replacing with credientals easy .... if anyone knows how to work in a "probing" .sh for that info to use on the full install let me know I will work it in
