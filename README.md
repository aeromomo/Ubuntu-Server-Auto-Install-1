# Ubuntu Server Auto Install 
(Currently Using 16.04.2 LTS Server 64bit as of 3/20/2017)

My setup is great for Fresh installs and for Reinstall with applying current settings

Credit for begining work on Creating Custom Auto Install Server ISO
https://pricklytech.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/ubuntu-server-unattended-installation-custom-cd/

Steps are under Wiki for installation and creating the ISO

Before creating ISO edit FirstbootInstall.sh unless on usb flash drive for control on what programs install with commenting out unneeded programs

If anyone has ideas to help set up the process faster or add more programs to this list feel free to reach out to me

For my Media server protection I will be replacing username, passwords with xxxusernamexxx and xxxpasswordxxx to help with replacing with credentials easy .... if anyone knows how to work in a "probing" .sh for that info to use on the full install let me know I will work it in 


Take a look also to my mini plex server instructions / might create a auto install for it soon to
