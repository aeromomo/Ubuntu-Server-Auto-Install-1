# Ubuntu Server Auto Install

Credit for begining work on Creating Custom Auto Install Server ISO
https://pricklytech.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/ubuntu-server-unattended-installation-custom-cd/

Quick break down for creating iso is in the Creating ISO.txt

Before creating ISO edit FirstbootInstall.sh unless on usb flash drive for control on what programs install with commenting out unneeded programs

If anyone has ideas to help set up the process faster or add more programs to this list feel free to reach out to me
