Debian/Ubuntu

Install dependencies:

apt update && apt install libmono-cil-dev curl mediainfo
Now proceed to Set up Radarr

Set up Radarr

Change to the install directory. In this case, /opt.

cd /opt
Get the latest tar link from https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr/releases and pull it to the install directory with wget.

wget https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr/releases/download/v0.2.0.99/Radarr.develop.0.2.0.99.linux.tar.gz
Extract the tar file.

tar -xvzf Radarr.develop.0.2.0.99.linux.tar.gz

Modern Linux systems have been updated to use the new systemd standard. The method is very simple and involves creating a service file then enabling it.

Create the service file

Be sure to modify the user, group, mono path and install directory.

cat > radarr.service << EOF
[Unit]
Description=Radarr Daemon
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
User=username
Group=group

Type=simple
ExecStart=<path to mono> <path to Radarr.exe> -nobrowser
TimeoutStopSec=20
KillMode=process
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
Move the file to your systemd system directory

Typically located in /usr/lib/systemd/system/, verify before proceeding. Will differ based on distribution.
For Ubuntu 16.04 it's /lib/systemd/system/.

mv radarr.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/
Add Radarr to startup

systemctl enable radarr.service
Start Radarr service

Start radarr via systemd and verify status.

systemctl start radarr.service
systemctl status radarr.service
If Radarr does not restart after an update, add the following to your systemd service unit:

ExecStop=-/usr/bin/mono /tmp/radarr_update/Radarr.Update.exe "ps aux | grep Radarr | grep -v grep | awk '{ print $2 }'" /tmp/radarr_update /opt/Radarr/Radarr.exe
