Linux

Mono 3.10 or later is required.

Debian/Ubuntu

mono

mono 3.10 is included for x86/x64 in our repo (mirrored from Xamarin's). Some platforms, however, have trouble with dependencies whilst installing Sonarr.

If you experience mono dependency issues whilst installing Sonarr

Install all the repo's from mono's official site: 
http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/

sudo apt-get install libmono-cil-dev
Add Sonarr's repository to your software source

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys FDA5DFFC
echo "deb http://apt.sonarr.tv/ master main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sonarr.list

If you have issues with the repo being https you can install the apt-transport-https package or switch to http

Install/Update Sonarr

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nzbdrone 
Start Sonarr

mono --debug /opt/NzbDrone/NzbDrone.exe
Open Browser

Modern Linux systems have been updated to use the new systemd standard. The method is very simple and involves creating a service file then enabling it.

Create the service file

Be sure to modify the user, group, mono path and install directory.

cat > sonarr.service << EOF
[Unit]
Description=Sonarr Daemon
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
User=<service username>
Group=<service group>

Type=simple
ExecStart=<path to mono> <path to NzbDrone.exe> -nobrowser
TimeoutStopSec=20
KillMode=process
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
Move the file to your systemd system directory

Typically located in /usr/lib/systemd/system/, verify before proceeding. Will differ based on distribution.
For Ubuntu 16.04 it's /lib/systemd/system/.

mv sonarr.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/
Add Sonarr to startup

systemctl enable sonarr.service
Start Sonarr service

Start sonarr via systemd and verify status.

systemctl start sonarr.service
systemctl status sonarr.service
